\section{Introduction}
The N-body problem is a well-known problem in physics and it has several applications ranging from modeling the gravitational interactions in galaxies and solar systems to simulating charged particle dynamics in plasmas and atoms in molecular systems.

Depending on the goal of the analysis, various assumptions can be relaxed or adjusted. In the experiments I conducted, I considered a closed system of $N$ point masses interacting solely through gravitational forces. This assumption is quite reasonable when modeling astronomical systems, especially when the goal is to compute the trajectories of celestial bodies within them. In such systems, the gravitational force dominates due to the extremely large masses involved, allowing other forces to be safely neglected.

Numerous algorithmic solutions have been proposed to address the N-body problem, many of which have been implemented in software to automate the computation of relevant physical quantities.

This work does not aim to propose a new or improved algorithmic solution. Instead, given an existing approach, the focus is on developing a parallel implementation that highlights the complexities involved in distributing the computation and evaluates its performance in a distributed environment.

Essentially the objectives of this work were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item to analyze a possible serial algorithm for solving the N-body problem;
\item to perform an \emph{a priori} study of the available parallelism using Amdahl's Law;
\item to develop a parallel implementation using the Message Passing Interface (MPI);
\item to evaluate performance and scalability through experiments conducted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Physical Model}
In order to understand the algorithm it is important to recall the physics laws on which the model is based.
\begin{itemize}
\item Newton's law of universal gravitation:
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{i,j}=G\frac{m_{i} m_{j}}{\|\vec{r}_{i}-\vec{r}_{j}\|^3}(\vec{r}_{j}-\vec{r}_{i})
\label{eq:gravitation}
\end{equation}
\begin{description}
    \item[\( G \)] Gravitational constant.
    \item[\( m_i, m_j \)] Masses of bodies \( i \) and \( j \).
    \item[\( \vec{r}_i, \vec{r}_j \)] Position vectors of bodies \( i \) and \( j \).
    \item[\( \vec{F}_{i,j} \)] Force acting on body \( i \) due to body \( j \).
\end{description}
Please note that $\vec{F}_{i,j}$ is an attractive force that has the same direction of the displacement vector \mbox{$(\vec{r}_j - \vec{r}_i)$}.
\item Newton's second law of motion:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
\label{eq:motion}
\end{equation}
It states that the sum of all the forces $\Sigma\vec{F}$ acting on a particular point mass is equal to the product between its mass $m$ and its acceleration $\vec{a}$.
\end{itemize}
In our scenario we can combine~\eqref{eq:gravitation} and~\eqref{eq:motion} to obtain, at a certain time instant, the acceleration $\vec{a}_i$ of point mass $m_i$ implied by all the gravitational forces acting on that point mass. Analytically we can write:
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}_i=\sum_{\substack{j=0 \\ j \neq i}}^{N-1}\left[G\frac{m_j}{\|\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j\|^3}(\vec{r}_j-\vec{r}_i)\right]
\label{eq:acceleration}
\end{equation}
Since we are ultimately interested in the trajectory of each body, from $\vec{a}_i$ we can compute the velocity $\vec{v}_i$ and the position $\vec{r}_i$ of mass $i$ by simply integrating $\vec{a}_i$ with respect to time.
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_i(t_k) = \vec{v}_i(t_{k-1}) + \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \vec{a}_i(\tau)\, d\tau
\label{eq:continuous_v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{r}_i(t_k) = \vec{r}_i(t_{k-1}) + \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \vec{v}_i(\tau)\, d\tau
\label{eq:continuous_r}
\end{equation}
\begin{description}
\item $t_{k-1}$ Time instant defining the initial condition for the current time step.
\end{description}
Although the notation $t_k$ and $t_{k-1}$ may initially appear cumbersome, it will prove useful later when expressing the iterative numerical formulation of the problem.
\subsection{Iterative Nature of the N-body Solution}
It is important to note that for systems involving more than two bodies (\( N > 2 \)), the N-body problem does not admit a general closed-form solution. This means that it is not possible to determine the complete trajectories of all bodies analytically from the initial conditions alone.

In the special case \( N = 2 \), the problem can be reduced to a one-body system by moving to the center-of-mass reference frame. In this frame, the motion can be fully described using relative coordinates, and a closed-form analytical solution can be derived for the position and velocity of each body. However, as soon as a third body is introduced, the system becomes non-linear and highly sensitive to initial conditions, making analytical solutions intractable in the general case~\cite{heggie2005classical}.

For this reason to compute the position of one particular mass at time $k$ it is necessary to iteratively solve the equations of motion (\eqref{eq:acceleration},\eqref{eq:continuous_v},\eqref{eq:continuous_r}) for all the $N$ bodies at each time step $t \leq k$. This is required because, as shown in \eqref{eq:acceleration}, the acceleration at time $k$ depends on the positions of all the bodies at that time.
Just from this consideration we can already anticipate the high computational cost.

\subsection{Numerical Integration}
At each step we have to carry out numerical integration. To be more precise numerical integration means to solve a first-order differential equation (ODE). In continuous time domain it consists in solving the following problem (to be more concise it will be shown it for the velocity magnitude $v$ only):
\begin{equation} % '&' is used as alignment point.
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dv}{dt} &= f(v, t) \\
v_0 &= v(t_0)
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
\begin{description}
\item $v_0$ is the known velocity at time $t_0$.
\item $f(v,t)$ is the right-end term in \eqref{eq:acceleration}.
\end{description}
